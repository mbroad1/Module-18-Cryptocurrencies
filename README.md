# Module 18 Cryptocurrencies Analysis
## Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate and group current cryptocurrencies in the market for a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio. The best way to understand the relationships and patterns between cryptocurrencies for this analysis is by performing unsupervised machine learning on a given cryptocurrency dataset using Python machine learning libraries.

## Results:
By performing unsupervised machine learning on the cryptocurrency dataset, we were able to create a 3D visualization showing cryptocurrencies with similar traits such as the amount of total coins supplied and total coins mined. This graph is helpful because it reveals which cryptocurrencies are worth investing in â€“ for example, the coins clustered with BitCoin may be worthy in investing in since they share similarities with a well-established, successful cryptocurrency like BitCoin.

Likewise, we also created a 2D scatter plot of the total supply of coins vs the total amount of coins mined, which will reveal which clusters of coins are higher in value in which ones are not based on their position in this plot.
